Vignette is a face tracking software for characters using [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). Unlike most solutions, Vignette is:

- Made with osu!framework, the game framework that powers [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu), the next iteration of [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh).
- Open source, from the very core.
- Always evolving - Vignette improves every update, and it tries to know you better too, literally.
