Vignette is a facetracking software for Live2D-based models using [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). Unlike most solutions, Vignette is:

- Built always on the latest C# standards - Made with osu!framework, a game engine that powers [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu), the next iteration of osu!.
- Open source, from the very core - Vignette is completely free and open source. No gotchas. 
- Always evolving - Vignette improves every update, and it tries to know you better too, literally.

## Running

We provide releases from GitHub Releases and also from Visual Studio App Center. Vignette releases builds for a select few people before we create a release here, so pay attention.

If you cannot wait, we have our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/vignette-project/vignette/wiki/Contributing-Guide) to guide you through the build process.
